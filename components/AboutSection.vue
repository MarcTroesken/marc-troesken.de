            As Expertise Lead for Cloud Engineering at DKB Service GmbH, I lead a chapter of over 20 engineers
            building the cloud platform that underpins one of Germany's largest digital banks. My work sits at the
            intersection of technology strategy and people leadership — defining how teams build, deploy, and
            operate infrastructure at scale in a highly regulated financial environment.

          <p>
            I believe great cloud infrastructure is invisible: it enables product teams to ship fast without
            worrying about security, compliance, or reliability. That means investing in self-service platforms,
            reusable Terraform modules, and guardrails that make the secure path the easiest path. Every
            architecture decision is guided by operational excellence, cost efficiency, and audit readiness.

          <p>
            Before moving into leadership, I spent years as a hands-on cloud engineer and infrastructure architect
            at Ratepay, where I co-led a full cloud migration from on-premise to AWS. That journey — designing
            network segmentation, implementing Zero-Trust architecture, and building CI/CD pipelines for
            infrastructure — gave me the technical depth that informs how I lead today.
          </p>
          <p>
            My approach to engineering leadership centres on empowerment and continuous growth. I mentor engineers
            into senior technical roles, foster a culture of knowledge sharing, and champion practices like
            GitOps, policy-as-code, and observability-driven development. The best platform teams don't just
            build infrastructure — they build the standards and tooling that make every team in the organisation
            more effective.
